<h3> "Banking on Trust"</h3>

<p>In banking halls where order must prevail,<br>
    A brouhaha of shenanigans may start,<br>
    A kerfuffle that tellers must curtail,<br>
    To keep the hootenanny well apart.</p>

<p>In banking halls where order must prevail,<br>
    A brouhaha of shenanigans may start,<br>
    A kerfuffle that tellers must curtail,<br>
    To keep the hootenanny well apart.</p>

    <p>But lollygagging is a tempting vice,<br>
        For some nincompoops, wasting time is sweet,<br>
        Yet bankers must be brisk, precise and nice,<br>
        And make sure customers don't miss a beat.</p>

        <p>Compliance data must be kept in line,<br>
            As data leaks can cause a great surprise,<br>
            And banks must work with utmost care to shine,<br>
            And pass regulatory gaze with prize.</p>

    <p>
    So let us heed the call of duty's fate,<br>
    And bank on trust, with no time to belate.<br>
